# Image_processing
This repository includes models trained in the "" paper. 


Here are some of the abbrevations used for naming the files:

CNN: convolutional neural networks
SVM: support vectior machines
image_D3: only phase-contrast images taken on day 3 of differentiation were used as input to the model
image_D5: only phase-contrast images taken on day 5 of differentiation were used as input to the model
mixed_D3: Both images from the day 3 of differentiation and experimental features were used as inputs to the model
mixed_D5: Both images from the day 5 of differentiation and experimental features were used as inputs to the model
