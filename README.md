# Image_processing
This repository includes models trained in the "Differentiating Engineered Tissue Images and Experimental Factors to Classify Cardiomyocyte Content" paper. 


Here are some of the abbreviations used for naming the files:

- CNN: convolutional neural networks
- SVM: support vectior machines
- image_D3: only phase-contrast images taken on day 3 of differentiation were used as input to the model
- image_D5: only phase-contrast images taken on day 5 of differentiation were used as input to the model
- mixed_D3: Both images from day 3 of differentiation and experimental features were used as inputs to the model
- mixed_D5: Both images from day 5 of differentiation and experimental features were used as inputs to the model
